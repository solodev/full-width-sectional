# full-width-sectional
Contemporary web design often blends fixed-width containers with full-width sectionals. By utilizing a full-width sectional, you can highlight specific content pieces, reinforced by an appropriate image that captures your audience's attention. Determining which content to place in a fixed-width container or a full-width sectional is mainly dependent on two things - the importance of the content and messaging as well as its supporting visual medium (graphic, video, icons, slider). Determining what content should be placed where should feel intuitive to you, simply align your content and messaging placement with its level of importance to your organizational goals.
